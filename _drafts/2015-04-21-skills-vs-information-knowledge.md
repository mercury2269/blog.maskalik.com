I've watched a [great video course](http://www.pluralsight.com/courses/learning-technology-information-age) by [Dan Appleman](http://danappleman.com/) on pluralsight about learning in the information age. And I found it thought provoking with visions similar to mine about what's important for us as developers and how we can optimize our learning for maximum effectiveness. 

Dan mentions how in this day and age the information and knowledge are accessible in an instant and are most likely free. So it matters a lot less of what person knows but rather what can he do. The ability to take the information and do something with it is called "Skills", and I couldn't aggree more with him.

To make our learning meaninful and not waiste precious time, we need to step back and think what's important for us as developers and how we can maximize our learning effectiveness. Does it really make sense to invest time to learn another new shiny framework, or would learning to understanding patterns and techniques of good programs that will never go obsolete be more meaningful use of our time?

Knowledge and information becomes obsolete with times but the ability to solve problems and fundamentals transcent through time.

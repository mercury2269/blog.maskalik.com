title: "Skills vs Information & Knowledge"

After watching a [great video course](http://www.pluralsight.com/courses/learning-technology-information-age) by [Dan Appleman](http://danappleman.com/) about learning in the information age, I found it thought provoking with visions similar to mine about what's important for us as developers, and how we can optimize our learning for maximum effectiveness. 

Dan mentions how in this day and age the information and knowledge are accessible in an instant and are most likely free. So it matters a lot less of what person knows but rather what can he do. The ability to take the information and do something with it is called "Skills", and I couldn't aggree more with him. 

I had a very interesting conversation with a friend who works at one the largest banks and he was telling me about his coworker who has every possible project management certification. His certifications are also is something that he is proud of and he even has many of it listed next to his name in the Linkedin. However, when the time comes to execute a project he gets lost in details and analysis. He is having problems executing not because he lacks knowledge but because he hasn't developed skills and abilities to execute.

The only way to develop skills is to actually solve challenging problems. These problems have to push you beyond your comfort zone in order to be benefitial. And, no, just doing your day to day job that your are used to and comfortable doing is not actually making you better.

To make our learning meaninful and effective, we need to step back and think what's important for us as developers and how we can maximize our learning effectiveness. Does it really make sense to invest time to learn another new shiny framework, or would learning to understanding patterns and techniques of good programs, that will never go obsolete, be more meaningful use of our time?

The idea of obtaining mastery is to present yourself with a deliberate challenging practice over a long period of time that will deepen the understanding of a given subject. By spreading our focus on multiple subjects we never obtain mastery in any of them. It just happpens that doing the same thing in a different language or framework doesn't actually make us better, it takes a lot of time to learn, but is this time really well spent? Are you actually improving by being challenged or are u just building the same thing you know how to do. 

In this day and age developers are contantly bombarded with new and exciting open source projects, interesting new languages, cloud services, operating systems, and etc. And it's very easy to loose sight of what's important. When was the last time rather jumping into learning something new you gave it some thought and asked some critical questions like "Is this the absolutely essential thing that I should be doing right now?" or "How is it going to move me towards my goals?". Unfortunately most of the time we default to chargning ahead without thinking, and when the next shiny object merges on the horizon we switch to it without actually obtaining mastery in either one.
